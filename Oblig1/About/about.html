        <h2>Semantics</h2>
          <p>Before we started the work, we read up on semantic tags to ensure that we would use them correctly.</p>
          <p>We also read through earlier lab tasks, and used some of their contents as inspiration for our own page</p>
      </article>

        <h2>Contents</h2>
          <p>We made it astronaut themed, because we thought it would be funny</p>
          <p>
            As for the different contents on our page, we mostly just followed the points on the task page. 
            We made a fictional persona, and all of the hobbies, skills etc. is about him.
          </p>
          <p>For the portfolio page, 
            we were not quite sure what to put, so we made two achievements from mr. Astronauts life 
            + one shameless self-promotion of one of my Youtube videoes. Please Subscribe ðŸ˜Ž</p>

        <h2>Use of HTML elements and CSS properties</h2>
          <p>One of our main goals from the start of the project, was to keep the website scalable to phone compatible, 
            which is the reason for not using any exact pixel sizes for width or height. And also using the CSS property relative.
          </p>
            <p>
            Div element was used for its dynamic and customizeble attributes, this was also a huge part of the scalability of the webpage.
          </p>
          <p>
            We used alot of classes to help keep the webpages CSS not interfere with eachother, 
            also som IDs were used for special circumstances where the one element need to change.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of the CSS was able to be in the stylesheet, but some had to be put into each pages own CSS element to make overrides where it was needed.
             Having most of the CSS in the stylesheet also helped keep the look and feel of all the pages the same theme.
